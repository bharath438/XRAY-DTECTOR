The X-ray Detection Streamlit app involves two primary actors: the User (such as a doctor) and the AI System. The user can upload chest X-ray images in formats like .jpg or .png to the system. Once an image is uploaded, the AI model processes it to predict whether the lungs are Normal or show an Abnormality. The system then provides prediction probabilities to give transparency about its confidence. Users can also view a sample X-ray image included in the app for quick testing. The app’s interface, powered by Streamlit, ensures that these interactions are simple and intuitive. The AI model works in the background to analyze images efficiently. Uploading an image triggers the prediction workflow automatically. Viewing probabilities allows users to understand the certainty of the AI’s classification. Overall,
